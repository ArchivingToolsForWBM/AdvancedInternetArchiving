If Links are not in the HTML itself but is inside a JS code that writes the link into a clipboard (that probably social media sites do for links to the posts), I would strongly recommend monkey-patch this:

	navigator.clipboard.writeText = async function(data) {
		console.log(data);
	}

This overrides JS from writing directly to the clipboard to instead the console log.

However, if you want to go full-automation, beware that the clipboard API requires the document to be focused, so this:

	document.getElementsByTagName("button")[<number>].click()

must be this instead:

	if (document.hasFocus()) {
		//<some other code here>
		document.getElementsByTagName("button")[<number>].click()
	}
